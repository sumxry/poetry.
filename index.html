            <h2>Love Killed Poets</h2>
            <p>Love killed poets, <br> May love also kill me. <br><br> With every word, I bleed inside, <br> A shattered soul, no place to hide. <br><br> My heart was open, pure, and true, <br> But love tore it, piece by piece, through. <br> They said it would heal, <br> But all it did was steal. <br><br> I write these lines with trembling hands, <br> For I know this is where it ends, <br> Love took my breath, my mind, my soul, <br> Leaving me empty, no longer whole. <br><br> Love killed poets, <br> And it will kill me too, <br> For when love dies, <br> There’s nothing left to do. </p>

            <h2>The Last Breath</h2>
            <p>Love killed poets, <br> and it will kill me too. <br> For when love dies, <br> there’s nothing left to do. <br><br> Soul born in a house that never felt warm, <br> Raised in the echoes of endless storms. <br> A boy who learned love through broken glass, <br> Holding onto dreams that would never last. <br><br> She came like a whisper, soft and kind, <br> A touch that healed, a love so blind. <br> But distance is cruel, and fate’s unfair, <br> She stayed in my heart but was never there. <br><br> Now I sit in the dark where silence screams, <br> Haunted by ghosts named shattered dreams. <br> The weight is heavy, the air is thin, <br> A battle I fight but cannot win. <br><br> Maybe I’ll live in the lines I write, <br> A ghost in ink, a voice in night. <br> And when I’m gone, just read me through— <br> Maybe then, I’ll exist for you. <br><br> But love killed poets, <br> It will kill me. </p>

            <h2>Her</h2>
            <p>And then… she came, so gentle, so kind, <br> A girl who healed the cracks in my mind. <br> She was a little shorter, with specs on her face, <br> Big, beautiful eyes filled with grace. <br> Her pink lips spoke words like a song, <br> And her cold, delicate hands held me strong. <br> Her short hair danced with every move, <br> She was the one thing I didn’t want to lose. <br><br> For the first time, I felt alive, <br> In her presence, I learned to survive. <br> She never loved me, yet I loved her still, <br> She became my light, my broken heart’s will.</p>

            <h2>Fading Away</h2>
            <p>I used school as a distraction, <br> But it didn’t ease the attraction, <br> Of my mind that’s stuck in place, <br> A heart lost in empty space. <br><br> I played songs to numb the pain, <br> But they only stir the rain, <br> The beats don’t heal, they just confuse, <br> Another way to feel abused. <br><br> I wrote poems from deep inside, <br> But now the words just run and hide, <br> The paper’s blank, no voice to hear, <br> Just silence ringing loud and clear. <br><br> I sit in the dark, hoping for light, <br> But it’s just me and my endless fight, <br> Chasing dreams that slip away, <br> And waiting for tomorrow, another day. </p>

            <h2>Love</h2>
            <p>Love is the fire that lights the dark, <br> A spark in the soul, a burning mark. <br> It whispers softly, it shouts aloud, <br> A heart beats louder, lost in the crowd. <br><br> In your eyes, I see the stars, <br> In your touch, I’ve traveled far. <br> Every kiss, a sweet refrain, <br> A melody that soothes my pain. <br><br> Love, it’s wild, it’s free, it’s true, <br> Forever lost in me and you.</p>

            <h2>Terror of Silence</h2>
            <p>The shadows crawl, the walls they speak, <br> Whispers from places where light won’t peek. <br> Eyes that follow, never seen, <br> Hands that touch, cold and keen. <br><br> Footsteps echo in the dead of night, <br> But no one’s there, just endless fright. <br> The air grows thick, the room feels tight, <br> As something stirs just out of sight. <br><br> A scream that chokes, a door that’s locked, <br> The terror’s real, but time’s been mocked. <br> In the silence, it waits, it hides, <br> A nightmare where no one survives.</p>

            <h2>My Girl in Green</h2>
            <p>She’s standing in the green with golden dupatta on her right <br> Face tilted down with eyes big and bright, <br><br> Yellow golden flowers are also in the frame <br> But everything fades that comes against her name, <br><br> Looking like an angel calm and sincere <br> Seeing her without glasses is lovely and rare.</p>

            <h2>Echoes of a Broken Soul</h2>
            <p>I am Summry, a soul lost in the dark, <br> A fragile boy, carrying endless scars. <br> Born into a house where love was a lie, <br> Where screams echoed, and hope would die. <br><br> I watched my mother, her tears never dry, <br> As my father’s rage tore her sky. <br> Each day he broke her with words and fists, <br> And I, too small, could only exist. <br><br> I prayed for it to stop, for it to end, <br> But prayers, it seems, aren’t meant to mend. <br> For years I sat in silent and death was near, <br> Looking for someone, to care. <br><br> Then there was Naman, my only friend, <br> The one who promised he’d never bend. <br> He saw me when no one else could, <br> He stayed by my side when no one would. <br><br> And then… she came, so gentle, so kind, <br> A girl who healed the cracks in my mind. <br> She was a little shorter, with specs on her face, <br> Big, beautiful eyes filled with grace. <br> Her pink lips spoke words like a song, <br> And her cold, delicate hands held me strong. <br> Her short hair danced with every move, <br> She was the one thing I didn’t want to lose. <br><br> For the first time, I felt alive, <br> In her presence, I learned to survive. <br> She saw my pain, yet loved me still, <br> She became my light, my broken heart’s will. <br><br> But life, as cruel as it’s always been, <br> Ripped me away like I have done many sin. <br> I was sent to a land, cold and strange, <br> Where loneliness became my cage. <br><br> The nights were long, and silence screamed, <br> Of love I lost and dreams I dreamed. <br> I clung to her voice across the phone, <br> But even her warmth couldn’t reach my bones. <br><br> I cried in the dark, where no one could see, <br> Begging for the world to set me free. <br> My heart grew heavy, my soul turned gray, <br> And each passing moment, I faded away. <br><br> Naman and she tried to hold me near, <br> But I drowned in a sea of fear. <br> Every tear I cried was a silent plea, <br> Why does life take everything from me? <br><br> I hug my mother when she’s finally home, <br> But even in her arms, I feel alone. <br> The pain inside, I can’t explain, <br> It’s a storm of sorrow, a flood of pain. <br><br> I am Summry, broken and torn, <br> A boy who’s tired of being worn. <br> I cry for love, for peace, for rest, <br> But life always takes and gives me less. <br><br> And yet, in the shadows, a flicker remains, <br> A fragile hope amidst the chains. <br> For maybe, one day, I’ll find my way, <br> And Summry’s heart will feel love’s ray.</p>

            <h2>My Girl in Glasses</h2>
            <p>Her eyes behind glasses, big and bright <br> Sparkling softly, like stars at night. <br><br> Her lips a sweet and gentle pink <br> Should I kiss? Make me pause and think. <br><br> Her hands always cold, I hold and fear <br> Heat waves come when she’s near. <br><br> If she’s the cheeks I’ll be her tear <br> Born from her eyes, end on lips, then disappear...</p>

            <h2>No Name</h2>
            <p>Far away my heart still calls your name <br> I know you never feel the same. <br><br> In every night you’re the dream I see <br> Even though you’re not here with me, <br><br> No matter the distance or time apart <br> You will always live inside my heart.</p>
